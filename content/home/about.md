# Follow the carbon

The Socio-Spatial Carbon Collaborative, or (SC)<sup>2</sup>, aims to deepen understanding of social and ecological inequalities in the built environment and share this knowledge with the public and policymakers. The project is currently developing a nationwide, neighborhood-scale, household carbon footprint database of unprecedented detail. (SC)<sup>2</sup> is led by Daniel Aldana Cohen and Kevin Ummel and is based at the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Population Studies Center.

Existing scholarship shows that population density and income influence carbon footprints. But we know comparatively little about how household demographics, inequality, housing policy, proximity to public infrastructure, and other socio-environmental features shape lifestyles and their ecological impact. Since these phenomena are also key determinants of health and well-being, "following the carbon" at high resolution allows us to link traditionally separate research agendas: how to foster low-carbon lifestyles, and how to live well and equitably in a warming world.
